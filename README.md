##  Goal

This repository provides a **community-maintained block list of AI-generated, low-effort websites ("AI-Slop")** for Pi-hole.  
These sites are often auto-generated, clickbait, or scraper content that clutters your browsing experience.  
By using this list in Pi-hole, you can block these sites at the DNS level and improve your internet experience.
